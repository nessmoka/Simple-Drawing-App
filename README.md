Simple Drawing App
This JavaFx application allows users to draw on the canvas. The user is able to select
between five different tools. They are able to draw freehand, create shapes, and erase
their work. The application also allows the user to choose the color they wish to use.
This is a simple application that is easy to use.

**simpledrawingApp class**
This class implements all of the subclasses in order to display the canvas and make it
a functional application. This class creates the color picker and the buttons. I have 
made the canvas resizable so that the user is able to draw more.

**drawingTool class**
This class implements the subclasses of each tool and creates the choicebox. Through 
this class the choicebox button is given actions. 

There are five tools:
- Freehand tool
- Circle tool
- Square tool
- Triangle tool
- Eraser tool
