# Simple-Drawing-App
CSI2300 Project Proposal						Vanessa Padilla

1.	Project name- Simple Drawing Application 
-	By myself

2.	I will be trying to build a Simple Drawing App that will allow a user to create different shapes using their mouse. I want to build this to learn how to be able to create an app that is usable in different ways. I think it is useful for me to learn, and it also serves as a fun app for the user. The app will allow a user to quickly draw a shape with little effort and the shapes can be used for various things.  Although, it seems like a simple application I hope the user is able to have fun and realize that even simple apps have a lot of work put into them. 

3.	My drawing app will have many classes/interfaces that will be used towards its creation. The app itself will need the Main class in order to run the whole program. There will be a drawingTool class to create the outline of what each subclass will do. Each shape will need its own class, I plan to do at least 3 shapes. So my program will include a drawSquare class, drawTriangle class and drawCircle class. I also plan to add an eraserTool class in order to allow the user to erase their drawings and start over.

5.	I plan to spend a lot of time working on the app and perfecting it. I will spend time on each class and do testing after creating many changes to ensure for a smooth program. I hope to make the app easy to use and with no problems. To do this I plan on working on the application and them doing some testing to ensure it works fine.
